		<h3><b>about me</b></h3>
		<p>
I study computational models of neural adaptation and gain control at NYU, supervised by Eero Simoncelli and David Heeger.
I spend most of my time training and simulating neural networks, and formulating unsupervised-learning objective functions.
		</p>
		<p>
I'm a born-and-raised Canadian; and before coming to the US, I completed my BSc in Physiology and Physics
			at McGill University. I received my MSc from the University of Western Ontario, studying normalization models of attention in
			prefrontal cortex under the supervision of Julio Martinez-Trujillo.
		</p>
		<p>
My technical interests include machine learning in computer vision, numerical linear algebra, and scientific computing.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing jazz guitar, cycling, and running.

			Vietnamese is a tonal language so it's hard to describe via text, but saying  <b><em>"Yuh-ng" </em></b> will get you close.
		Most pronounce it like "Dew-ong"/"Dwong", which is also fine.

		<h3><b>about me</b></h3>
		<p>
I study computational models of neural adaptation and gain control at NYU, supervised by Eero Simoncelli and David Heeger.
I spend most of my time training and simulating neural networks, and formulating unsupervised-learning objective functions.
		</p>
		<p>
Before coming to the US, I received my MSc from the University of Western Ontario, studying the dynamics of normalization in prefrontal cortex during attention under the supervision of Julio Martinez-Trujillo.
I completed my BSc at McGill University in Physiology and Physics.
		</p>

		<p>
My technical interests (about which I sometimes write) include: machine learning in computer vision, numerical linear algebra, and scientific computing.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing jazz guitar, cycling, and running.

		<small><b>how to pronounce Dương, <script type="text/javascript" src="https://forvo.com/_ext/ext-prons.js?id=3163552"></script>: </b>
		<span>
			Vietnamese is a tonal language so it's hard to describe via text, but saying  <b><em>"Yuh-ng" </em></b> 
 (the d sounds like a "y", and "uo" sounds like "uh") will get you close.
		Most pronounce it like "Dew-ong"/"Dwong", which is perfectly fine.

    <h3><b>about me</b></h3>
    <p>
        I'm a computational & theoretical neuroscience PhD student at NYU advised by Eero
        Simoncelli and David Heeger.
        My dissertation focuses on theories of adaptive efficient coding in recurrent neural networks, and
        developing statistical tools for analyzing neural representational geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2022, I was a PhD intern on the Open Codecs team at Google where I did a research project on
        machine learning for video compression with adaptive nonlinear autoencoders.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada ü•∂üçÅ.
        My BSc is in Physiology and Physics from McGill University, where I began working on what
        would eventually become my MSc at the University of Western Ontario (our lab migrated),
        modeling neural correlates of visuo-spatial attention in prefrontal cortex, advised by Julio
        Martinez-Trujillo.

        <small><b> hear me pronounce my Vietnamese family name, D∆∞∆°ng:
                <audio id="player" src="assets/audio/Duong.m4a"></audio>
                <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('player').play();event.preventDefault();"><i
                        class='fa fa-volume-up'></i></a> </b>
            <span>
                Saying <b><em>"Yuh-ng" </em></b> will get you close (the D sounds like a Y in English).
                Most people pronounce it like "Dew-ong" or "Dwong", which I'm fine with.
            </span></small>

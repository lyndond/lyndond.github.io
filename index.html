    <h3><b>about me</b></h3>
    <p>
        I'm a PhD student at NYU studying computational models of neural population adaptation, supervised by Eero
        Simoncelli and David Heeger.
        My dissertation focuses on adaptive gain control in recurrent neural networks, and develops (variational)
        auto-encoder objectives for modeling neural data.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Summer of 2022, I'll be working as a PhD Intern on the Open Codecs team at Google, Mountain View, CA,
        hosted by Bohan Li.
        My research project is on adaptive auto-encoders and efficient nonlinear transforms for next-generation video
        compression.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a born-and-raised Canadian üçÅ.
        I received my BSc in Physiology and Physics at McGill University, where I began working on what
        would eventually become my MSc obtained from the University of Western Ontario (our lab migrated),
        modeling neural correlates of visuo-spatial attention in prefrontal cortex under the supervision of Julio
        Martinez-Trujillo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of research, I enjoy playing jazz guitar, cycling, and running.

                Vietnamese is a tonal language so it's hard to describe via text, but saying <b><em>"Yuh-ng" </em></b>
                will get you close.
                Most pronounce it like "Dew-ong"/"Dwong", which is also fine.

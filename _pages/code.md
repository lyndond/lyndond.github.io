Some open-source software that I maintain.

This Python package is a PyTorch framework for digging into the inner workings of hierarchical visual models (e.g. deep nets). The part of the package to which I contribute most is ``synthesize/eigendistortion`` and models in the ``simulate`` branch. It is a fun mix of machine learning and numerical linear algebra.

I started learning Python in 2015 by working through the textbook "Analyzing neural time series data" by Mike Cohen, and translating all of its code from MATLAB. There's a ton of nice signal processing tools in here, and to my surprise it now has over 120 stars on GitHub.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lyndond/lyndond.github.io/blob/master)
All code from blog posts will be pushed to this repo.

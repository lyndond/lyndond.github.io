Some open-source software that I maintain.

## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> ``plenoptic.py`` ](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--large} 

This Python package is a PyTorch framework for digging into the inner workings of hierarchical visual models (e.g. deep nets).
I help build and maintain this repo with some friends in the lab.
The part of the package to which I contribute most is ``synthesize/eigendistortion`` and its related code. It was a fun mix of machine learning and numerical linear algebra.


## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> ``analyzing neural time series data``](https://github.com/lyndond/Analyzing_Neural_Time_Series){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--large}

I've recommended the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Neural-Time-Data-Practice/dp/0262019876) Analyzing neural time series data by Mike Cohen to anyone I've met starting out in neural data analysis. 
In 2015, I set out to translate the book's entire MATLAB codebase (thousands of lines) to Python in Jupyter notebooks , but abandoned it because it was quite frankly an insane use of my free time. Fast forward to 2021 -- I learned that it had somehow accumulated 100+ stars and about 60+ forks on GitHub, so I figured why not finish what I started. 


## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> ``misc. code from blog posts``](https://github.com/lyndond/lyndond.github.io/tree/master/code){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--large} 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lyndond/lyndond.github.io/blob/master)
All code from blog posts will be pushed to this repo.

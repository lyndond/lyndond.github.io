Here are some links and info about open-sourced code I work(ed) on.

## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> plenoptic.py ](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic) 

This Python package is a PyTorch framework for .
I help build and maintain this repo with some friends in the lab.
The part of the package to which I contributed the most was ``synthesis/eigendistortions`` and its related code. It was a fun mix of machine learning and numerical linear algebra.


## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> analyzing neural time series data](https://github.com/lyndond/Analyzing_Neural_Time_Series) 
I've recommended the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Neural-Time-Data-Practice/dp/0262019876) Analyzing neural time series data by Mike Cohen to anyone I've met starting out in neural data analysis. 
In 2015, I set out to translate the book's entire MATLAB codebase (thousands of lines) to Python in iPython notebooks (now called Jupyter), but abandoned it because it was quite frankly an insane use of my free time. Fast forward to 2021 -- I learned that it had somehow accumulated 100+ stars and about 60+ forks on GitHub, so I figured why not finish what I started. 

## [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> misc. code from blog posts](https://github.com/lyndond/lyndond.github.io/tree/master/code) 
All code from blog posts will be pushed to this repo.

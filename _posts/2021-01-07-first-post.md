Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print(f"Hi, {name}")

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

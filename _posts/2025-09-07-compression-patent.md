A happy surprise several years later...
<!--more-->

A few years ago, I wrote about my [PhD internship experience at Google]({% post_url 2022-11-01-google-internship %}), where I worked on machine learning for video compression.
It was a summer in which I basically had no life and worked the entire 3 months, but it eventually paid off with the research turning into a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095879) and oral presentation at ICASSP 2023 in Rhodes, Greece.

In a fun and unexpected turn of events, I just discovered that the core research from that internship was also filed as a patent by Google, and it has since been published.

The patent is titled **"Learned transforms for coding"** with the publication number `WO2024081009A1`.

It covers the nonlinear transform model I developed, which uses a multi-rate adaptive autoencoder and hyperprior to improve compression efficiency on video prediction residuals.
